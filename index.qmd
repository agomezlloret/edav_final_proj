Experiencing the 2024 New York City Marathon for the first time was a transformative moment for us. The energy coursing through the city streets was palpable—crowds cheered, competitors pushed themselves to the limit, and the shared emotion between runners and spectators created a unique, unforgettable atmosphere. In a city often defined by its fast pace and individualism, this event stood out as a rare moment of unity. It felt as though the entire city had come together for a day to celebrate determination, perseverance, and community spirit. This experience underscored for us that the marathon is more than just a race; it is a powerful symbol of collective ambition and support.

This newfound appreciation inspired us into thinking that maybe we could run the race next! To prepare for this journey, we wanted to delve deeper into the data from the 2024 race. Analyzing this dataset offers us insights not only for our training strategy but also to better understand the dynamics of marathon running. By studying various aspects of the race, we aim to uncover trends that can guide our preparation and shed light on what it truly takes to participate in such a remarkable event.

Our project focuses on answering several key questions that we believe will be both interesting and informative:

 - How do women’s finish times compare to men’s finish times? We want to identify whether there is an age range where female times are comparable or even superior to male times.
 - What is the most common finish time for women in their 20s and 30s? By finding this ‘average’ time, we hope to set realistic goals for ourselves and understand typical performance benchmarks.
 - Which country, apart from the United States, had the highest representation? Furthermore, we seek to explore which non-U.S. country performed best in terms of average finish times.
 - How many participants over the age of 60 completed the marathon, and what was the distribution of their finish times? This analysis will provide insight into the capabilities and dedication of older runners, showcasing the marathon’s inclusivity across age groups.

Our aim is to provide readers with an engaging overview of the 2024 NYC Marathon through data-driven insights that highlight its diversity, competitiveness, and spirit. Whether you are a running enthusiast, a data analyst, or someone inspired by community events, this exploration seeks to share the compelling stories hidden within the race statistics.
