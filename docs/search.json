    "text": "1 Introduction\nExperiencing the 2024 New York City Marathon for the first time was a transformative moment for us. The energy coursing through the city streets was palpable—crowds cheered, competitors pushed themselves to the limit, and the shared emotion between runners and spectators created a unique, unforgettable atmosphere. In a city often defined by its fast pace and individualism, this event stood out as a rare moment of unity. It felt as though the entire city had come together for a day to celebrate determination, perseverance, and community spirit. This experience underscored for us that the marathon is more than just a race; it is a powerful symbol of collective ambition and support.\nThis newfound appreciation inspired us to take on the challenge of running the marathon ourselves next year. To prepare for this journey, we wanted to delve deeper into the data from the 2024 race. Analyzing this dataset offers us insights not only for our training strategy but also to better understand the dynamics of marathon running. By studying various aspects of the race, we aim to uncover trends that can guide our preparation and shed light on what it truly takes to participate in such a remarkable event.\nOur project focuses on answering several key questions that we believe will be both interesting and informative:\n\nHow do women’s finish times compare to men’s finish times? We want to identify whether there is an age range where female times are comparable or even superior to male times.\nWhat is the most common finish time for women in their 20s and 30s? By finding this ‘average’ time, we hope to set realistic goals for ourselves and understand typical performance benchmarks.\nWhich country, apart from the United States, had the highest representation? Furthermore, we seek to explore which non-U.S. country performed best in terms of average finish times.\nHow many participants over the age of 60 completed the marathon, and what was the distribution of their finish times? This analysis will provide insight into the capabilities and dedication of older runners, showcasing the marathon’s inclusivity across age groups.\n\nOur aim is to provide readers with an engaging overview of the 2024 NYC Marathon through data-driven insights that highlight its diversity, competitiveness, and spirit. Whether you are a running enthusiast, a data analyst, or someone inspired by community events, this exploration seeks to share the compelling stories hidden within the race statistics.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThe dataset was scraped by researcher and analyst Joe Hovde from the official NYC Marathon results page for the 2024 NYC Marathon, held on November 3, 2024. The official results page is maintained by the event organizers and provides a comprehensive record of all participants’ results. The data is presented in a tabular format with 17 columns and 55,525 rows. The columns include detailed attributes such as participant age, gender, country, overall time, pace, placement (overall and by category), and the number of marathons completed by each individual. With data on the run times and ages of 55 thousand runners, this is sure to be an interesting project! This dataset is static for the 2024 marathon and future updates would depend on the availability of results from subsequent marathons and similar scraping efforts. Even though this is not a dynamic dataset, it could serve as a valuable component for an ongoing project that analyzes trends over multiple years, capturing the sheer talent that participates year after year.\nQuestions for future research could center around analyzing impacts of national or global events and how that affects participation from certain countries. We will import the data into R using read.csv and then will take steps to pre-process the data and conduct any required cleaning before we begin to answer our posed questions.",

To address this, we decided to transform the dataset by replacing blanks and “-” with NA. After this transformation, we found that 308 NA values remained in the ‘stateProvince’ column, 12 remained in the ‘countryCode’, 12 in ‘bib’, 12 in ‘gender’, and 62 in ‘city’. Initially, we speculated that the missing values in ‘stateProvince’ might be due to certain countries not having a ‘stateProvince’ field for competitors to fill in. However, upon further investigation, we filtered for missing values in the ‘stateProvince’ column and identified distinct ‘countryCode’ values. This revealed that the USA also had missing entries, suggesting that some competitors chose not to provide a ‘stateProvince’ value.\n\n\nCode\nunique_country_codes$countryCode[is.na(unique_country_codes$countryCode)] &lt;- \"Unknown\"\n\nunique_country_codes &lt;- unique_country_codes |&gt; \n  mutate(countryCode = reorder(countryCode, n)) \n\nggplot(unique_country_codes, aes(x = n, y = countryCode)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"lightpink\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label=n), vjust = .5, hjust = 0, color = 'darkblue') +\n  labs(title = \"Missing stateProvince Values by Country\",\n       x = \"Missing Values\",\n       y = \"Country Code\") +\n  theme_minimal()",
